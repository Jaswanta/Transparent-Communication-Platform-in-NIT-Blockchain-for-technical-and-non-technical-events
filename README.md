# Transparent-Communication-Platform-in-NIT-Blockchain-for-technical-and-non-technical-events

We have created one blockchain based application for transparent communication in the technical and non-technical events organised in an NIT.

## Getting Started

We have used the hyperledger fabric to model our own application using the different script files.

### Tech Stack

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
