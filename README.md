# Transparent-Communication-Platform-in-NIT-Blockchain-for-technical-and-non-technical-events

We have created one blockchain based application for transparent communication in the technical and non-technical events organised in an NIT.

## Getting Started

We have used the hyperledger fabric to model our own application using the different script files.

### Tech Stack

Hyperledger Composer
CLI Tools(command line interface)
RESTful APIs
Hyperledger Fabric
POW(proof of work) Algorithm
Go language
java Script

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Acknowledgments
1. Trust:
The smart contract can’t be lost as its embedded in the blockchain itself.
2.Accuracy:
Smart contracts are accurate to the limit a programmer has accurately coded them for execution.
3.Speed:
Smart contracts use software code to automate tasks, thereby reducing the time it takes to maneuver through all the human interaction related processes. Because everything is coded, the time taken to do all the work is the time taken for the code in the smart contract to execute.
4.Backup:
Every node in the blockchain maintains the shared ledger, providing probably the best backup facility.
5.Autonomy:
There is no third part involved. The contract is made by you and shared between the parties. No intermediaries involved which minimizes bullying and grants fully authority to the dealing parties. Also, the smart contract is maintained and executed by all the nodes on the network, thus removing all the controlling power from any one party’s hand
6.Safety:
Cryptography can make sure that the assets are safe and sound. Even if someone breaks the encryption, the hacker will have to modify all the blocks that come after the block which has been modified. Please note that this is a highly difficult and computation intensive task and is practically impossible for a small or medium sized organisation to do.
7.Savings:
Smart contracts save money as they eliminate the presence of intermediaries in the process. Also, the money spent on the paperwork is minimal to zero
